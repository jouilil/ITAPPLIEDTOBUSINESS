```{admonition} Learning Objectives

The first part of this course is intended to make students familiar with some basic algorithms and their efficiency analysis. Specifically, the course aims to:

- **Understand algorithmic concepts**: Familiarize students with the foundational principles of algorithms, including the basics of algorithm design, analysis, and the role of data structures in problem-solving.

- **Analyze algorithm efficiency**: Teach students how to evaluate algorithms based on their time and space complexity, using asymptotic analysis to assess performance.

- **Master fundamental data structures**: Provide in-depth understanding of essential data structures and their role in optimizing algorithm performance.

- **Design algorithms for common computational problems**: Enable students to design algorithms to solve practical problems efficiently, focusing on sorting, searching, graph traversal, and dynamic programming.

- **Implement algorithms in practice**: Provide students with hands-on experience in implementing a range of algorithms using programming languages, ensuring the correct and efficient functioning of these algorithms.

- **Develop problem-solving skills**: Foster the ability to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable components, and use algorithmic techniques to solve them efficiently.

- **Explore advanced algorithmic topics**: Introduce students to more complex topics such as greedy algorithms, divide and conquer strategies, and network flows, preparing them for more advanced studies in algorithm theory and applications.
