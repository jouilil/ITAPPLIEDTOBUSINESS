:class: tip

**A truth table** is a logical tool used to evaluate the truth values of a logical expression based on all possible combinations of truth values for its variables.

A truth table is a tool that helps you analyze statements or arguments in order to verify whether or not they are logical, or true

```

#### .1. Not Statements

The “not” is simply the opposite or complement of its original value.

Here’s the table for negation:

- $P$ represents the original truth value.

- $\neg P$ is the negation of $P$ .

#### 2. And Statements


Here's the truth table for p and  q

**Key points:**

- These statements are true only when both p and q are true


#### 3. Or Statements

Here's the truth table for p or q

**Key points:**

- These statements are false only when both p and q are false

#### 4. Implies Statements


Here's the truth table for p implies q

**Key points:**

- p implies q is false only when p is true and q is false.

- In all other cases, 𝑝 implies q is true

#### 5. Equivalence Statements


Here's the truth table for p equivalent to q

**Key points:**

- p equivalent to q is true when both 𝑝 p and 𝑞 q have the same truth value (both true or both false)

- p equivalent to q is false when they have different truth values
